GUI readme:

I: Interprocess communication

A: GUI->Server
The GUI passes commands to the server through a pipe from stdout.
Commands will take the form of $COMMAND$BOTNUMBER.
In the case of multiple commands each command will be on a separate line.
The commands are
Upload payload to a bot: $UP$
Launch bot payload: $LP$
Retrieve files from bot: $RF$
Get bot status $GS$

For example, to retrieve prepared files from bots 1,3, and 4, the GUI will
send to it's stdout:
$RF$1
$RF$3
$RF$4.

B: Server -> GUI
When the server requests a list update the list should return in the format:
BOT#;IP;OS;Architecture\n
where each bot is written as a separate line.
When the upload is complete the server shoul write a single line containing $.
