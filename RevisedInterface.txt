

This interface makes use of three delimiters
FIELD_DELIMITER - $
BOT_DELIMITER - :
UPDATE_DELIMITER - ' ' (a single space)

I: Receiving commands
All commands from the GUI to the server will have
the following format:
	$COMMAND_CODE$BOT_FIELD$OPTIONAL
	
The defined COMMAND_CODEs:
	GETBOTSTATUS = "$GS$";
    UPLOADPAYLOADS = "$UP$";
    LAUNCHPAYLOADS = "$LP$";
	RETRIEVEFILES = "$RF$";
	
The BOT_FIELD has the following format:
	BOTID:BOTID2:BOTID3:...:BOTIDn

The OPTIONAL field is used to contain any extra information
necessary to operatie the command. For UPLOADPAYLOADS and
RETRIEVEFILES the optional field will contain the relevant
file path / directory respectively.

All commands will conclude with "...\r\n". This is an artifact
of how Java is writing commands to the outputstream.

II: Sending botlist updates
When replying to GETBOTSTATUS the format is:
	BOTID BOTIP BOTOS:BOTID2 BOTIP2 BOTOS2:
The receiver is flexible and any additional information
associated with a BOTID can be stored after BOTOS with 
spaces between information fields.
